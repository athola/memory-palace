# Coffee

### Cold Brew

#### [Premium BOSS Black Coffee](https://www.suntory.com/softdrink/news/pr/d/SBF0227.html)

This coffee comes in a metal can, and has an easy to open screw top. The flavor is rich, but is not as bold as I would like it to be. There is no sweetener in this coffee, just the pure, black coffee bean flavor.  3/5 stars.

#### [UCC Unsweetened Black Coffee](https://www.yamibuy.com/en/p/ucc-unsweetened-black-coffee-288ml/1020001241?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=SnackBeverage_en&gclid=CjwKCAiA65iBBhB-EiwAW253W5AD817jCxUpQo3EU2YIw-LM4RsG8ePcYYogiAPV8h0ybMaRGZvWCxoCNcgQAvD_BwE)

This coffee comes in a metal can, and has an easy to open screw top. The flavor is a bold, distinctive coffee taste, without being too overpowering. I would describe it as smooth and creamy, while still retaining its boldness. There is no sweetener in this coffee either, and it does a great job of standing on its own with the flavor. 4.5/5 stars.

#### [Georgia Coffee Original](https://www.amazon.com/Georgia-coffee-original-250g-can/dp/B06XZ2HL51)

This coffee comes in a metal can with a pop top. The flavor is bold, smooth, and refreshing. It's a bit sweeter than I like it, but for a sweetened coffee, this is a wonderful pick. 4/5 stars.
