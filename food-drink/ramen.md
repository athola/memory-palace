This ramen bowl came well packaged, and the pictures of the cooked noodles looked very appetizing. It came with two smaller pouches, one of which contained the soup base, which had a rich, spicy aroma and crimson color, and the other which contained green onion and other small, dried vegetables. It cooked quickly within the 3 minutes, and mixed easily with the base/vegetables. The spice didn't seem to overwhelm the noodles, and stayed mostly in the broth, which I consider to be a good thing. Not too oily, although the broth could have benefited from being slightly creamier. The vegetables we a nice complement, and I wouldn't say the spice was overwhelming, maybe a medium spice level. Overall, this was a good instant ramen and I would certainly get it again. 3/5 stars.
