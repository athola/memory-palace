# Welcome to Alex's Memory Palace

A [digital garden](https://cagrimmett.com/notes/2020/11/08/what-are-digital-gardens/) where I store mental impressions as a variation on a [memory palace](https://artofmemory.com/wiki/Virtual_Memory_Palaces) in the form of an online Gitbook hosted on [GitHub.](https://github.com/athola/memory-palace)

* Thoughts
* Ideas
* Papers
* Links to websites and blogs
* More TBD

Referencing [Nikita Boloboev's](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xy) wiki for inspiration.
